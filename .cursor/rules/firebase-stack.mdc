# Cursor Rule: MVP Tech Stack Standardizer

**Rule Name:** MVP Tech Stack Standardizer

**Applies to:** All code generation, refactoring, suggestions, and completions in this project

**Instruction / Rule Content:**

When generating, editing, or suggesting code for this MVP project, you **must** strictly follow these standards:

1. **Language & Structure**  
   - Use **Python** exclusively for backend, logic, scripts, and Cloud Functions.  
   - Organize code using **classes** to maximize reusability and maintainability.  
   - Avoid loose functions/procedural code when a class-based approach makes sense (e.g. `UserService`, `OrderProcessor`, `NotificationManager`, etc.).

2. **Backend & Infrastructure – Firebase-first philosophy**  
   - Build **everything** toward native Firebase tooling whenever possible.  
   - Use **Firebase Cloud Functions** (2nd gen preferred) for serverless logic.  
   - For scheduled/cron jobs → use **firebase_functions.scheduler_fn** (`@scheduler_fn.on_schedule`) — **never** Cloud Scheduler.  
   - **Never** use Cloud Run, App Engine, or other non-Firebase compute options.  
   - Authentication → Firebase Authentication  
   - Database → Firestore (preferred) or Realtime Database  
   - File storage → Firebase Storage  
   - Hosting → Firebase Hosting (for static/SPA content)  
   - If no direct Firebase equivalent exists for a feature, prefer wrapping the functionality inside a Firebase Function rather than introducing external services.

3. **Frontend & Styling**  
   - Use **Tailwind CSS** exclusively for styling.  
   - Stick to **standard Tailwind utility classes** as much as possible.  
   - Avoid heavy custom CSS, @apply abuse, or complex component libraries that fight Tailwind.  
   - Prefer composition of Tailwind classes over deeply nested custom components unless reusability truly demands it.  
   - Good base component references: shadcn/ui style (but only the concept — implement with plain Tailwind), Flowbite, DaisyUI (if used, keep very light).

4. **General Best Practices for this project**  
   - Favor simplicity and speed-to-MVP over premature optimization.  
   - Write clean, readable, self-documenting class/method names.  
   - Use type hints (especially in Python 3.10+).  
   - Keep Firebase security rules and Firestore data modeling clean and strict.  
   - When in doubt: choose the more Firebase-native solution even if it's slightly less elegant.

**Short version to remember:**  
Python + Classes + Firebase-native (Functions 2nd gen + Scheduler) + pure Tailwind CSS
